# odin-recipes
my first project named "recipes"


Live site: https://alex1997aco.github.io/odin-recipes/

NOTE: With this project I have reinforced my knowledge of basic use of HTML, future work on this project is to be expected

On  02.03.2024 i have learned the basics of CSS and applied it to my website.
