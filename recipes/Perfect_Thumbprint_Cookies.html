         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>
            My mother, Pauline, made really nice thumbprint cookies,
            but I never wrote down her recipe. I knew the ingredients, 
            but unless you have the right proportions, you won't get that perfect melt-in-your-mouth texture.
             So, I did an image search and found a recipe that looked very similar, credited to a great-grandma named Mitzi. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Since my last name is Mitzewich, that pretty much sealed the deal. 
            In case you can't decide between a shortbread-focused cookie and a jammier one, here's how to make both.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup unsifted powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon almond extract</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅓ cup white sugar, or as needed</li>
            <li>½ cup fruit jam, divided</li>
        </ul>
